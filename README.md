STROKE RISK & DETERMINANTS ANALYSIS
Project Overview
This project analyzes a healthcare dataset to identify key demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors associated with stroke risk. The goal was to transform raw patient data into actionable insights using an end-to-end analytics workflow: Python → SQL → Power BI.
Objective
•	Identify major determinants of stroke
•	Analyze relationships between stroke and risk factors
•	Build an interactive dashboard for data-driven decision-making
Data & Tools
Dataset: Healthcare Stroke Dataset (CSV)
Tools Used:
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning and loading
•	SQL (SSMS) – Structured analysis and querying
•	Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard development
Methodology
•	Data Cleaning (Python):
•	Handled missing values (BMI)
•	Standardized categorical variables
•	Checked for inconsistencies and outliers
•	Data Storage & Analysis (SQL):
•	Loaded cleaned data into SQL Server
•	Performed analytical queries on stroke risk, demographics, and comorbidities
Visualization (Power BI):
Built a multi-page interactive dashboard:
•	Demography
•	Stroke Distribution & Risk Factors
•	Risk stratification (Metabolic & Geographic Patterns)
Key Findings
•	Stroke risk increases significantly with age
•	Patients with hypertension and/or heart disease have higher stroke rates
•	Former smokers exhibit the highest stroke incidence among smoking groups
•	Higher glucose levels and BMI are associated with stroke outcomes
•	Self-employed individuals show the highest stroke rates across locations
